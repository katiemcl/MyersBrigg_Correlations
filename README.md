# MyersBrigg_Correlations

This repository contains an R Notebook analyzing changes in my personal mood, sleep, weather, and Myers Brigg Type Indicator 
(MBTI). Initially, this analysis was coded in Python on a Jupyter Notebook for my final project in WRI 150 at Princeton 
University. The project investigates the idea that MBTI stays constant for an individual and accurately describes personality
among other traits.

Sem2Observations.csv: contains data imported from iOS apps Daylio (weather, mood), Apple Health + Pillow Automatic Sleep Tracker
(sleep), and manual weekly entries of MBTI from [16personalities.com](https://www.16personalities.com)
